  Muskoka Woods is an incredible place to spend your Summer. If you've worked here

        Hi, I'm Tim Davidson, your Area Head for this season! I was born and
        raised in Northern Ireland, but also lived in England for eight years and
        Canada for one. I currently study Interaction Design at Belfast School of
        Art and Design.
        Basically it's graphic and web design (in case you hadn't already guessed)
        with a little bit of magic.
        When I'm not studying I work in NI's only 5 Star hotel, it's
        pretty sweet, I also do some freelance graphic design. Outside of work I really
        enjoy listening to music, watching TV shows and movies, hanging out with people,
        and water sports like sailing and kayaking.
      </h2>
      <h2 class="about">
        This is my third Summer at Muskoka Woods but my fifth season. Last year
        I had the opportunity to spend my gap year working on site as an instructor. During that time
        I got my Ropes Level 1 and Level 2 and instructed before joining the Summer high
        ropes staff, so I got to play about on the course a lot. It's a cool job
        and you can have some wild fun!

    The Team
  </h1>
        <h2 class="team">
          <!--This Summer's team should be made up of 10 instructors and myself.--> Everyone has
          been chosen carefully because of their abilities and their personalities.
          If you're feeling nervous before coming up to camp, don't be, you'll fit
          right in. Just remember, Muskoka Woods chose you
          and you're here for a reason! As well as staff week,
          you guys will be going through ropes training to gain your Level 1. This
          is a great time to become a team and get to know each other
          over late nights reading green binders and tying endless amounts of knots
          in rope that's almost too short to tie knots in! What's awesome is that
           you guys get a qualification that can be used in a job
          when returning home after camp, your Level 1 qualifies you for a year. So
          make the most of it, quit school and go work at Treetop Trekking for a year!
        </h2>
        <h2 class="team">
          I can't wait to see everyone bond together as a team at the ropes shed.
          Bring something unique to you that will add to the positive vibe of the team and the Muskoka
          Woods community! You'll be surprsised at the people you meet, the friends
          you leave with and the things you learn whether that be a new climbing
          technique or which drink combinations are the best in the dining halls (if you
          mix them all, it's something quite special)!

  Apparel

  Every year, each section produces their own apparel that they can wear during their time
  at camp and then forevermore. This year the plan is to get t-shirts. The design, front
  and back, is shown below. It'll be great to
  see everyone wearing them. The plan is to get them ordered ASAP so we can wear them
  all season.

  Camp can be even more fun if you bring the right sort of clothes. Here are a few ideas of things
  you may want to remember to pack. Some are pretty obvious, others
  not so much. Muskoka Woods is always full of surprises! If there is anything missing or that you're
  not sure about, get in touch with me I'm happy to answer any questions.
