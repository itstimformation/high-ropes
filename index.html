  Welcome to the Muskoka Woods 2017 ropes team! It's great to have all of you
  guys on board and it's set to be an exciting Summer this year. I can't wait to
  meet all of you guys in person and work alongside you throughout the season!
  Muskoka Woods is an incredible place to spend your Summer. If you've worked here
  before, welcome home. If this is your first time working here you're about to
  discover something really special. I hope this season that we all get to know each
  other better and create an awesome community of instructors and a tight team.

        My name is Tim Davidson and I'm your area head this season! I was born and
        raised in Northern Ireland, but also lived in England for eight years and
        Canada for one. I currently study Interaction Design at Ulster University.
        Basically it's graphic and web design (in case you hadn't already guessed)
        with a little bit of magic.
        When I'm not working in Muskoka Woods I work in NI's only 5 Star hotel, it's
        pretty sweet, I also do some freelance graphic design. Outside of work I really
        enjoy listening to music, watching TV shows and movies, hanging out with people,
        and water sports like sailing and kayaking.
      </h2>
      <h2 class="about">
        This is my third Summer at Muskoka Woods but my fifth season. Last year
        I had the opportunity to work on site as an instructor for the year. During that time
        I got my Ropes Level 1 and did a lot of instruction before joining the Summer high
        ropes staff, so I got to play about on the course a lot. It's a cool job
        and there are so many different things you can do with ropes, there are
        always new challenges to try and different routes to explore. No two
        climbs are ever the same

    The Team
  </h1>
        <h2 class="team">
          This Summer's team is made up of 10 instructors and myself. Everyone has
          been chosen carefully because of their abilities and their genuine personalities.
          If you're feeling nervous before coming up to camp, don't be, you'll fit
          right in. Just remember, Muskoka Woods chose you over many other applicants
          and you're here for a reason! If you think you haven't got all the skills
          you think you'll need to be succesful, our team beleive you do, and if there
          is something missing, that's what staff weeks for. On top of that week,
          you guys will be going through ropes training to gain your Level 1. This
          is honestly such a great time to become a team and get to know each other
          over late nights reading green binders and tying endless amounts of knots
          in rope that's almost too short to tie knots in! This is also an awesome
          opportunity for you guys to get a qualification that can be used in a job
          when returning home after camp, your Level 1 qualifies you for a year, so
          make the most of it, quit school and go work at Treetop Trekking for a year!
        </h2>
        <h2 class="team">
          I can't wait to see everyone come together and bring all their differences
          to the ropes shed. Bring something unique to you, something to help others
          and to bring a real positive vibe to the whole team and Muskoka
          Woods community! You'd be surprsised at the people you meet, the friends
          you leave with and the things you learn whether that be a new climbing
          technique or which drink combinations are the best in the dining halls (if you
          mix them all, it's something quite special)!

  Apparel
</h1>
<h2 class="apparel">
  Every year, each section produces their own apparel that they can wear during their time
  at camp and then forevermore. The way this works is everyone pays for their own, I'm trying to
  keep the cost to a minimum. This year the plan is to get t-shirts. The design, front
  and back, is shown below. Hopefully everyone is down to get one. It would be great to
  see everyone together wearing them. The plan is to get them ordered ASAP so we can wear them
  all season. In past years, clothing is ordered super late and is only seen on camp for a week!
  My goal is to have them for staff week, so if I can get a response from everyone before
  then, heads will be turning during staff week!

  Camp can be even more fun if you bring the right sort of clothes. Here are a few ideas of things

  not so much. Muskoka Woods is always full of surprises! If there is anything missing or that you're
  not sure about, get in touch with me I'm happy to answer any questions.
